<h1>BASIC CALCULATOR</h1>

<h2>INTRODUCTION:</h2>
Basic Calculator ia a project which allow users to calculate the four basic operations in mathematics such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division but in this Project which I am implementing also includes three additional fundamental scientific operations such as calculating Factorial, Power and Modulas operations. The inputs includes the commands which as we can give numbers based on the operation for example, in addition opoeration if we give 1 as a command and that particular operation works. However, this calculator is smart enough to operate multiplication / division before addition / subtraction / factorial / power / modulas, in another words it is implemented with the order of precedence logic.

The switch-case statement is used to write a simple calculator program in C language. The remainder operator (%) is normally used with data values. To print the remainder operator (%%) is used in the first printf() function. The variable (ch) store the operator, similarly the variables num1, and num2 stores the two numbers. The switch has condition (“ch”) so the entered operator is matched with which case label those case label statements are executed, and displays the result to the screen. If the entered operator is not matched with the case labels then the default statement will be executed and it will display the message depcting “Error! Invalid Operator.”
